### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces) or in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers) or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure following the following steps. 

To change the azd parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md). 


1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
   ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (like "ckmapp")
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. 
    * This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data. 
    * If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment has completed successfully, open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.

6. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 
<!-- 6. You can now proceed to run the [development server](#development-server) to test the app locally, or if you are done trying out the app, you can delete the resources by running `azd down`. -->

<h2>

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).

<!-- ### How to customize 

If you'd like to customize the solution accelerator, here are some ways you might do that:
- Ingest your own [audio conversation files](./docs/ConversationalDataFormat.md) by uploading them into the storage account and run the process data scripts.
- You can also scale the solution and process large volumes of data by deploying this to Microsoft Fabric by following the steps in [Fabric_deployment.md](./docs/Fabric_deployment.md) -->
